We propose that the best marker of full employment is the efficient unemployment rate, u*. We define u* as the unemployment rate that minimizes the nonproductive use of labor\u0026mdash;both jobseeking and recruiting. The nonproductive use of labor is well measured by the number of jobseekers and vacancies, u + v. Through the Beveridge curve, the number of vacancies is inversely related to the number of jobseekers. With such symmetry, the labor market is efficient when there are as many jobseekers as vacancies (u = v), too tight when there are more vacancies than jobseekers (v \u0026gt; u), and too slack when there are more jobseekers than vacancies (u \u0026gt; v). Accordingly, the efficient unemployment rate is the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rates: u* = √uv. We compute u* for the United States between 1930 and 2022. We find that u* averages 4.2% over the period and, for instance, that the US labor market has been over full employment (u \u0026lt; u*) since May 2021.\nFigure 12C: Efficient unemployment rate, u* = √uv, in the United States, 1930\u0026ndash;2022 Citation: Michaillat, Pascal and Emmanuel Saez. 2022. \u0026ldquo;u* = √uv.\u0026rdquo; arXiv:2206.13012. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.13012.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/13/","summary":"Under simple but realistic assumptions, the efficient unemployment rate u* is the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rates.

P-hacking is problematic because it reduces the informativeness of hypothesis tests\u0026mdash;by making significant results much more common than they are supposed to be in the absence of true significance. Despite its prevalence, p-hacking is not taken into account in hypothesis testing theory: the critical values used to determine significance assume no p-hacking. To address this problem, we build a model of p-hacking and use it to construct critical values such that, if these values are used to determine significance, and if researchers adjust their p-hacking behavior to these new significance standards, then significant results occur with the desired frequency. Because such robust critical values allow for p-hacking, they are larger than classical critical values. As an illustration, we calibrate the model with evidence from the social and medical sciences. We find that the robust critical value for any test is the classical critical value for the same test with one fifth of the significance level\u0026mdash;a form of Bonferroni correction. For instance, for a z-test with a significance level of 5%, the robust critical value is 2.31 instead of 1.65 if the test is one-sided and 2.57 instead of 1.96 if the test is two-sided.\nFigure 3: Robust critical values for different parametrizations Citation: McCloskey, Adam and Pascal Michaillat. 2022. \u0026ldquo;Critical Values Robust to P-Hacking.\u0026rdquo; arXiv:2005.04141. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2005.04141.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/12/","summary":"This paper develops a model of p-hacking by researchers.

The model is economical in that it is solved with an aggregate demand\u0026ndash;aggregate supply diagram, and the effects of shocks and policies are obtained by comparative statics. The model builds on two unconventional assumptions. First, producers and consumers meet through a matching function. Thus, the model features unemployment, which fluctuates in response to aggregate demand and supply shocks. Secondly, wealth enters the utility function, so the model allows for permanent zero-lower-bound episodes. In the model, the optimal monetary policy is to set the interest rate at the level that eliminates the unemployment gap. This optimal interest rate is computed from the prevailing unemployment gap and monetary multiplier (the effect of the nominal interest rate on the unemployment rate). If the unemployment gap is exceedingly large, monetary policy cannot eliminate it before reaching the zero lower bound, but a wealth tax can.\nFigures 7 \u0026amp; 8: With a small unemployment gap, optimal monetary policy restores efficient unemployment.

While lowering unemployment puts more people into work, it forces firms to post more vacancies and to devote more resources to recruiting. This unemployment-vacancy tradeoff, governed by the Beveridge curve, determines the efficient unemployment rate. Accordingly, the unemployment gap can be measured from three sufficient statistics: elasticity of the Beveridge curve, social cost of unemployment, and cost of recruiting. Applying this formula to the United States, 1951\u0026ndash;2019, we find that the efficient unemployment rate averages 4.3%, always remains between 3.0% and 5.4%, and has been stable between 3.8% and 4.6% since 1990. As a result, the unemployment gap is countercyclical, reaching 6 percentage points in slumps. The US labor market is therefore generally inefficient and especially inefficiently slack in slumps. In turn, the unemployment gap is a crucial statistic to design labor-market and macroeconomic policies.\nFigure 7B: Unemployment gap in the United States, 1951–2019 Citation: Michaillat, Pascal and Emmanuel Saez. 2021. \u0026ldquo;Beveridgean Unemployment Gap.\u0026rdquo; Journal of Public Economics Plus 2: 100009. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubecp.2021.100009.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/9/","summary":"This paper develops a sufficient-statistic formula for the unemployment gap based on the Beveridge curve.

Because they do not observe firms\u0026rsquo; costs, customers must extract costs from prices. The theory assumes that customers infer less than rationally: When a price rises due to a cost increase, customers partially misattribute the higher price to a higher markup\u0026mdash;which they find unfair. Firms anticipate this response and trim their price increases, which drives the passthrough of costs into prices below one: Prices are somewhat rigid. Embedded in a New Keynesian model as a replacement for the usual pricing frictions, our theory produces monetary nonneutrality: When monetary policy loosens and inflation rises, customers misperceive markups as higher and feel unfairly treated; firms mitigate this perceived unfairness by reducing their markups; in general equilibrium, employment rises. The theory also features a hybrid short-run Phillips curve, realistic impulse responses of output and employment to monetary and technology shocks, and an upward-sloping long-run Phillips curve.\nFigure 1: Expansionary monetary shock in the New Keynesian model with fairness concerns Citation: Eyster, Erik, Kristof Madarasz, and Pascal Michaillat. 2021. \u0026ldquo;Pricing under Fairness Concerns.\u0026rdquo; Journal of the European Economic Association 19 (3): 1853–1898. https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaa041.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/8/","summary":"This paper develops a model of pricing in which buyers care about the fairness of markups but misinfer them from prices.

To resolve these anomalies, we introduce wealth into the utility function; the justification is that wealth is a marker of social status, and people value status. Since people partly save to accrue social status, the Euler equation is modified. As a result, when the marginal utility of wealth is sufficiently large, the dynamical system representing the zero-lower-bound equilibrium transforms from a saddle to a source, which resolves all the anomalies.\nFigure 1: Phase diagrams of the New Keynesian (NK) model and wealth-in-the-utility New Keynesian (WUNK) model, in normal times and at the zero lower bound (ZLB) Citation: Michaillat, Pascal and Emmanuel Saez. 2021. \u0026ldquo;Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies with Wealth in the Utility Function.\u0026rdquo; Review of Economics and Statistics 103 (2): 197\u0026ndash;215. https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00893.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/11/","summary":"This paper resolves the anomalies of the New Keynesian model at the zero lower bound\u0026mdash;explosive recession, forward guidance puzzle, multiplier puzzle\u0026mdash;by introducing wealth into the utility function.","title":"Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies with Wealth in the Utility Function"},{"content":" Paper Online appendix Code \u0026amp; data Abstract: This article proposes a theory of optimal public expenditure when unemployment is inefficient. The theory is based on a matching model. Optimal public expenditure deviates from the Samuelson rule to reduce the unemployment gap (the difference between current and efficient unemployment rates). Such optimal \u0026ldquo;stimulus spending\u0026rdquo; is described by a formula expressed with three sufficient statistics: the unemployment gap, the unemployment multiplier (the decrease in unemployment achieved by increasing public expenditure), and the elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption. When unemployment is inefficiently high and the multiplier is positive, the formula yields the following results. (1) Optimal stimulus spending is positive and increasing in the unemployment gap. (2) Optimal stimulus spending is zero for a zero multiplier, increasing in the multiplier for small multipliers, largest for a moderate multiplier, and decreasing in the multiplier beyond that. (3) Optimal stimulus spending is zero if extra public goods have no value, it becomes larger as the elasticity of substitution increases, and it completely fills the unemployment gap if extra public goods are as valuable as extra private goods.\nFigures 7 \u0026amp; 8: Great Recession in the United States: optimal stimulus spending and resulting unemployment rate, for various multipliers and elasticities of substitution between public and private consumption (ε).

We evaluate this belief using a model of scientific research and promotion in which tenured scientists are slightly biased toward tenure candidates with similar beliefs. We find that when a science lacks evidence to discriminate between theories, or when tenure decisions do not rely on available evidence, true theories may not be adopted. The nonadoption of heliocentric theory in the 16th century, the persistence of bloodletting in the 19th century, the nonadoption of underconsumption theory in the early 20th century, and the persistence of radical mastectomy in the 20th century illustrate such risk.\nAbstract: We develop a model describing how false paradigms may persist, hindering scientific progress. The model features two paradigms, one describing reality better than the other. Tenured scientists display homophily: they favor tenure candidates who adhere to their paradigm. As in statistics, power is the probability (absent any bias) of denying tenure to scientists adhering to the false paradigm. The model shows that because of homophily, when power is low, the false paradigm may prevail. Then only an increase in power can ignite convergence to the true paradigm. Historical case studies suggest that low power comes either from lack of empirical evidence, or from reluctance to base tenure decisions on available evidence.\nFigure 1: Dynamics of the share of Better scientists (𝜎) in the tenured population depending on the power of the scientific field.

This paper examines whether this policy is desirable.

Empirical evidence suggests that tightness is inefficiently low in slumps and inefficiently high in booms, and that an increase in UI raises tightness. Hence, the correction term is positive in slumps but negative in booms, and optimal UI is indeed countercyclical.

The model keeps the architecture of the general-disequilibrium model of Barro and Grossman (1971) but takes a matching approach to the labor and product markets instead of a disequilibrium approach. On the product and labor markets, both price and tightness adjust to equalize supply and demand. Since there are two equilibrium variables but only one equilibrium condition on each market, a price mechanism is needed to select an equilibrium. We focus on two polar mechanisms: fixed prices and competitive prices. When prices are fixed, aggregate demand affects unemployment as follows. An increase in aggregate demand leads firms to find more customers. This reduces the idle time of their employees and thus increases their labor demand. This in turn reduces unemployment. We combine the predictions of the model and empirical measures of product market tightness, labor market tightness, output, and employment to assess the sources of labor market fluctuations in the United States. First, we find that product market tightness and labor market tightness fluctuate a lot, which implies that the fixed-price equilibrium describes the data better than the competitive-price equilibrium. Next, we find that labor market tightness and employment are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor market fluctuations are mostly due to labor demand shocks and not to labor supply or mismatch shocks. Last, we find that product market tightness and output are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor demand shocks mostly reflect aggregate demand shocks and not technology shocks.\nFigures 1 \u0026amp; 3: Matching process and solution of the model of aggregate demand and idle time Citation: Michaillat, Pascal, and Emmanuel Saez. 2015. \u0026ldquo;Aggregate Demand, Idle Time, and Unemployment.\u0026rdquo; Quarterly Journal of Economics 130 (2): 507\u0026ndash;569. https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjv006.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/3/","summary":"This paper develops a model of unemployment fluctuations.
