The course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models.\nSo what is economic slack? Economic slack describes the amount of productive resources in the economy that are unused. There are many different forms of slack: people who cannot find a job and remain unemployed; machines left idle in a factory; employed workers left idle on the job; hotel rooms, restaurants table, airplane seats that remain vacant; durable goods that cannot be sold and depreciate; perishable goods that cannot be sold and perish.\nEconomic slack represents a waste of productive resources, and it therefore is something that should be limited. Moreover, in addition to its wastefulness, unemployment generates other, large costs to society. People who are unemployed suffer from lower mental and physical health than employed workers. Even employed people in areas with high unemployment report lower well-being. Accordingly, good economic policy should stabilize economic slack at a desirable level and avoid periods of elevated slack.\nThe course presents models of economic slack and discusses policies used to tackle slack. The course tries to answer several questions: Why does slack exist? How does it affect economic life? Why does slack vary over time? How are slack fluctuations related to price and wage rigidities? What is the socially optimal amount of slack? How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle? How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle? What happens to slack and policies at the zero lower bound? Does the effectiveness of policies depend on the prevailing amount of slack?\nWelcome to the Course Overview of business-cycle models This section first reviews the Kuhnian model of science. It then uses the Kuhnian perspective to understand how, over the past century, business-cycle macroeconomics evolved from the IS-LM model (inspired by Keynes\u0026rsquo;s General Theory) to the general disequilibrium model (with nonclearing markets) to the real business-cycle model (with perfectly competitive markets) and finally to the New Keynesian model (with monopolistically competitive markets).\nOrganization of Scientific Knowledge in Paradigms Cycling Through Paradigms Qualities of a Good Paradigm Structure of Business-Cycle Models Paradigms of Business-Cycle Research From the Keynesians to the New Keynesians Absence of Slack in Modern Business-Cycle Models Prevalence of slack and matching function This section documents the presence of slack on the labor market (unemployed workers) and on the product market (idle labor and capital). It also documents that such slack always coexists with vacant jobs and unfulfilled consumption. Then, it introduces the matching function, which is the tool that we will use to model the coexistence of unemployed workers and vacant jobs, and of idle labor and capital and unfulfilled consumption. The matching function summarizes the complex process through which workers searching for jobs meet firms searching for employees, and firms searching for customers meet consumers searching for sellers.\nPrevalence of Unemployed Workers Other Forms of Labor Market Slack Prevalence of Idle Capacity Other Forms of Product Market Slack Prevalence of Vacant Jobs Prevalence of Unfulfilled Consumption Matching Function and Matching Market Properties of the Matching Function Market Tightness and Trading Probabilities Urn-Ball Matching Function Cobb-Douglas Matching Function Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution Matching Function Basic model of slack This section develops the most basic macro model of economic slack. The model is static. It is built around a matching function. Because of the matching function, self-employed workers are not able to sell all their services: there is always some slack. Wealth (in the form of real money balances) enters the utility function. Thanks to this assumption, and although the model is static, the aggregate demand is nondegenerate.\nStructure of the Basic Model Household\u0026rsquo;s Production Function Product Market and Market Tightness Idle Capacity Matching Cost Matching Wedge Household\u0026rsquo;s Utility Function Household\u0026rsquo;s Budget Constraint Definition and Properties of the Household\u0026rsquo;s Problem Solving the Household\u0026rsquo;s Problem Computing the Aggregate Demand Curve Properties of the Aggregate Demand Curve Computing the Aggregate Supply Curve Properties of the Aggregate Supply Curve Price Norm Individual and Bilateral Surpluses from Trade Bilateral Inefficiencies in Keynesian and New Keynesian Models Bilateral Efficiency for any Price Norm Structure of the Solution of the Model Strategy to Solve the Model Computing Market Tightness from the AD and AS Curves Model of slack with income and wealth inequality This section introduces income and wealth inequality in the basic model of slack. It computes the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves, and shows how the model with inequality can be solved. In the model the marginal propensity to spend varies with slack, and the deviation from Say\u0026rsquo;s Law appears clearly.\nPrevalence of Income and Wealth Inequality Modeling Income and Wealth Inequality Matching in the Heterogeneous-Agent Model Consumption and Saving in the Heterogeneous-Agent Model Unequal Consumption and Savings in the Heterogeneous-Agent Model Slack-Dependent Marginal Propensity to Spend Aggregate Supply in the Heterogeneous-Agent Model Aggregate Demand in the Heterogeneous-Agent Model Solving the Heterogeneous-Agent Model How Much Rationality Does the Model Assume? How Can a Statistical Agency Predict Tightness? Discussion of the solution concept This section provides additional discussions of the solution concept used in the model of slack, and discusses an interesting special case. It also shows how the model solution is the equilibrium (in the sense from physics not economics) of a dynamical model in which households slowly learn the market tightness.\nGeneral Structure of the Model Solution Graphical Representation of the Model Solution Deviation from the Model Solution Recasting the Model in Terms of Visits Defining the Model Solution in Terms of Visits Solving the Model in Terms of Visits Solution of the Model in a Special Case With No Matching Cost Convergence to the Model Solution Price and wage rigidities This section argues that prices and wages are not fully flexible but instead somewhat rigid. Fairness seems to be a key reason behind price and wage rigidities. The section then shows how realistic pricing norms can be inserted into the model of slack. It computes comparative statics in response to AD and AS shocks under fixed prices and rigid prices. It contrasts these results to those obtained under bargained prices.\nSetting Prices under Bilateral Monopoly Why Are Prices Not Restricted to a Narrow Price Band Frequency of Price Changes Prevalence of Rigid Prices Frequency of Wage Changes Frequency of Wage Changes for New Hires Prevalence of Wage Rigidity Model Solution with Fixed Prices Comparative Statics with Fixed Prices Bargaining over Prices Model Solution with Bargained Prices Comparative Statics with Bargained Prices Model with Rigid Prices Model of slack with labor and product markets This section presents a model with two sectors and two types of slack: a labor market with unemployment and a product market with idleness. Unemployment and idleness interact with each other. For instance, after an increase in aggregate demand, firms find more customers. This reduces the idle time of firms\u0026rsquo; employees and thus increases firms\u0026rsquo; labor demand. This in turn reduces unemployment.\nStructure of the Two-Market Model Matching on the Labor and Product Markets Pricing on the Labor and Product Markets Firm\u0026rsquo;s Recruiting Process Firm\u0026rsquo;s Production Function Firm\u0026rsquo;s Problem Labor Demand and Labor Supply Curves Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Curves Structure of the Solution of the Two-Market Model Graphical Representation of the Two-Market Model Solution Keynesian, Classical, and Frictional Unemployment Solving the Two-Market Model Aggregate Demand Shocks with Fixed Prices Technology Shocks with Fixed Prices Labor Supply Shocks with Fixed Prices Dynamic model of slack This section presents a dynamic version of the model of slack. An advantage of moving to a dynamic environment is that interest rates appear into the model. Indeed, the real interest rate is a key determinant of aggregate demand. By setting a nominal interest rate, the central bank can stabilize the economy. The model is useful to quantify the effect of monetary policy on unemployment, and is therefore useful to quantify how soft the current Fed\u0026rsquo;s landing will be. If the Fed reduces market tightness from 2 to 1, we can expect the unemployment rate to rise from 4% to 5%.\nStructure of the Dynamic Model Matching with Long-Term Employment Relationships Law of Motion of Unemployment Convergence to the Beveridge Curve Aggregate Supply Curve in the Dynamic Model Recruiting Wedge Household\u0026rsquo;s Utility Function Household\u0026rsquo;s Budget Constraint Household\u0026rsquo;s Problem Price Norm and Monetary Policy Dynamics of the Model Aggregate Demand Curve and Solution of the Dynamic Model Aggregate Demand Shocks with Fixed Inflation Aggregate Supply Shocks with Fixed Inflation Effects of Monetary Policy and Soft Landing Social welfare, efficiency, and inefficiency The model of slack is generally inefficient. Except in a knife-edge case, there is too much or too little slack. The section therefore develops a sufficient-statistic formula for the efficient amount of slack. The section shows that the US economy is generally inefficient, and especially exceedingly slack in slumps.\nIntroduction to Social Welfare and Efficiency Introduction to the Efficient Unemployment Rate Introduction to Sufficient Statistics A Beveridgean Framework for Welfare Analysis Formula for Efficient Unemployment: u* = √uv Comparing Unemployment and Vacancies to Assess Efficiency Inefficiency of the US Economy Efficient Unemployment Rate in the United States Optimal monetary policy over the business cycle This section describes optimal monetary policy over the business cycle. Monetary policy influences the aggregate-demand curve, so it can be used to shrink the unemployment gap. In fact, the optimal monetary policy is to adjust interest rates to eliminate the unemployment gap entirely. So the central bank should lower rates in bad times, when unemployment is inefficiently high, and raise rates in good times, when unemployment is inefficiently low. Furthermore, since output and unemployment rate are negatively correlated (Okun\u0026rsquo;s law), aggregate-demand shocks must be a major source of business cycles. Since monetary policy controls aggregate demand, it is able to stabilize business cycles well.\nDivine Beveridge-Wicksell Framework Sufficient-Statistic Formula for Optimal Monetary Policy Estimates of the Monetary Multiplier Optimal Response to Unemployment Fluctuations Evaluating the Behavior of the Federal Reserve Monetary Policy in the Dynamic Model Beveridge Curve in the Dynamic Model Replacing Monetary Policy by a Wealth Tax at the ZLB Optimal government spending over the business cycle This section studies optimal public expenditure over the business cycle. It shows that that optimal public expenditure deviates from the Samuelson rule to reduce, but not eliminate, the unemployment gap. The amplitude of the deviation depends on the unemployment gap, fiscal multiplier, and elasticity of substitution between public and private goods. Since the unemployment gap is countercyclical, optimal public expenditure is also countercyclical. That is, the government should spend more in bad times and less in good times. The section also shows that in our model of slack, fiscal multipliers depend on the prevailing amount of slack, and are therefore cyclical.\nWhen Should Fiscal Policy Be Used for Stabilization?

We propose that the best marker of full employment is the efficient unemployment rate, u*. We define u* as the unemployment rate that minimizes the nonproductive use of labor\u0026mdash;both jobseeking and recruiting. The nonproductive use of labor is well measured by the number of jobseekers and vacancies, u + v. Through the Beveridge curve, the number of vacancies is inversely related to the number of jobseekers. With such symmetry, the labor market is efficient when there are as many jobseekers as vacancies (u = v), too tight when there are more vacancies than jobseekers (v \u0026gt; u), and too slack when there are more jobseekers than vacancies (u \u0026gt; v). Accordingly, the efficient unemployment rate is the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rates: u* = √uv. We compute u* for the United States between 1930 and 2022. We find that u* averages 4.2% over the period and, for instance, that the US labor market has been over full employment (u \u0026lt; u*) since May 2021.\nFigure 12C: Efficient unemployment rate, u* = √uv, in the United States, 1930\u0026ndash;2022 Citation: Michaillat, Pascal and Emmanuel Saez. 2022. \u0026ldquo;u* = √uv.\u0026rdquo; arXiv:2206.13012. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.13012.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/13/","summary":"This paper shows that under simple but realistic assumptions, the efficient unemployment rate u* is the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rates.

P-hacking is problematic because it reduces the informativeness of hypothesis tests\u0026mdash;by making significant results much more common than they are supposed to be in the absence of true significance. Despite its prevalence, p-hacking is not taken into account in hypothesis testing theory: the critical values used to determine significance assume no p-hacking. To address this problem, we build a model of p-hacking and use it to construct critical values such that, if these values are used to determine significance, and if researchers adjust their p-hacking behavior to these new significance standards, then significant results occur with the desired frequency. Because such robust critical values allow for p-hacking, they are larger than classical critical values. As an illustration, we calibrate the model with evidence from the social and medical sciences. We find that the robust critical value for any test is the classical critical value for the same test with one fifth of the significance level\u0026mdash;a form of Bonferroni correction. For instance, for a z-test with a significance level of 5%, the robust critical value is 2.31 instead of 1.65 if the test is one-sided and 2.57 instead of 1.96 if the test is two-sided.\nFigure 3: Robust critical values for different parametrizations Citation: McCloskey, Adam and Pascal Michaillat. 2022. \u0026ldquo;Critical Values Robust to P-Hacking.\u0026rdquo; arXiv:2005.04141. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2005.04141.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/12/","summary":"This paper develops a model of p-hacking by researchers.

The model is economical in that it is solved with an aggregate demand\u0026ndash;aggregate supply diagram, and the effects of shocks and policies are obtained by comparative statics. The model builds on two unconventional assumptions. First, producers and consumers meet through a matching function. Thus, the model features unemployment, which fluctuates in response to aggregate demand and supply shocks. Secondly, wealth enters the utility function, so the model allows for permanent zero-lower-bound episodes. In the model, the optimal monetary policy is to set the interest rate at the level that eliminates the unemployment gap. This optimal interest rate is computed from the prevailing unemployment gap and monetary multiplier (the effect of the nominal interest rate on the unemployment rate). If the unemployment gap is exceedingly large, monetary policy cannot eliminate it before reaching the zero lower bound, but a wealth tax can.\nFigures 7 \u0026amp; 8: With a small unemployment gap, optimal monetary policy restores efficient unemployment.

Absence of Unemployment in the Competitive Model Matching function This section reviews basic facts about the labor market and unemployment in the United States. It then introduces the matching function\u0026mdash;the main tool that we will use to model the labor market and unemployment. The matching function summarizes the complex process through which workers searching for jobs and firms searching for employees meet each other.\nOrganization of the Labor Market Unemployment Rate Vacancy Rate Beveridge Curve Job-Finding Rate Vacancy-Filling Rate Job-Separation Rate Matching Function Labor Market Tightness Matching model of the labor market This section introduces the matching model of the labor market. This is the model that we will use to study unemployment and unemployment policies in this course. The model was developed by Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen, and Christopher Pissarides in the 1980s (for this they received a Nobel Prize in 2010). Unlike in the neoclassical model, in the matching model all trades are mediated by the matching function. The section shows how to construct the labor supply and labor demand in the matching model, and how to solve the model using supply and demand.\nProperties of a Good Model According to Kuhn Notations Labor Market Flows Assumption of Balanced Flows Computing Labor Supply Properties of Labor Supply Organization of the Firm Computing the Recruiter-Producer Ratio Properties of the Recruiter-Producer Ratio Profits of the Firm Problem of the Firm Computing Labor Demand Properties of Labor Demand Review of Labor Supply and Demand Irrelevance of Unemployment Dynamics Finding the Wage in a Competitive Model Finding Labor Market Tightness in a Matching Model Graphical Representation of the Solution Complete Description of the Solution Wages This section presents empirical evidence on wages.

It first shows that the model with rigid wages generates realistic unemployment fluctuations. It then shows that the model with bargained wages is unable to generate such fluctuations. The reason is that bargained wages are too flexible.\nMatching Model with Rigid Wages Business-Cycle Shocks Labor Supply Shocks with Rigid Wages Labor Demand Shocks with Rigid Wages Elasticities Fluctuations in Labor Market Tightness with Rigid Wages Elasticity of Labor Supply Elasticity of the Recruiter-Producer Ratio Elasticity of Labor Market Tightness Wage Rigidity Required to Generate Realistic Fluctuations Matching Model with Bargained Wages Labor Supply Shocks with Bargained Wages Labor Demand Shocks with Bargained Wages Fluctuations in Labor Market Tightness with Bargained Wages Value from Unemployment Bargained Wages Cannot Generate Realistic Fluctuations Frictional and rationing unemployment This section turns to the sources of unemployment over the business cycle. It first establishes that usual matching models do not have job rationing. That is, all unemployment would disappear in these models if workers searched sufficiently hard. It then proposes a matching model with job rationing. In this model, in recession, jobs are lacking, so some unemployment remains even if workers are desperate to find a job. As a result, unemployment can be divided into a rationing and a frictional component. The frictional component is larger in good times and smaller in bad times.\nIntroduction to Job Rationing Evolution of Matching Models: Standard Model Evolution of Matching Models: Rigid-Wage Model Evolution of Matching Models: Job-Rationing Model All Unemployment is Frictional in Standard \u0026amp; Rigid-Wage Models Standard Model with Zero Recruiting Cost Rigid-Wage Model with Zero Recruiting Cost The Case of Infinite Job-Search Effort Standard Model with Infinite Job-Search Effort Rigid-Wage Model with Infinite Job-Search Effort Generating Job Rationing Unemployment with Zero Recruiting Cost Defining Rationing Unemployment When is Rationing Unemployment Positive?

It then extends the analysis to all models with a Beveridge curve\u0026mdash;not only the matching model.

While lowering unemployment puts more people into work, it forces firms to post more vacancies and to devote more resources to recruiting. This unemployment-vacancy tradeoff, governed by the Beveridge curve, determines the efficient unemployment rate. Accordingly, the unemployment gap can be measured from three sufficient statistics: elasticity of the Beveridge curve, social cost of unemployment, and cost of recruiting. Applying this formula to the United States, 1951\u0026ndash;2019, we find that the efficient unemployment rate averages 4.3%, always remains between 3.0% and 5.4%, and has been stable between 3.8% and 4.6% since 1990. As a result, the unemployment gap is countercyclical, reaching 6 percentage points in slumps. The US labor market is therefore generally inefficient and especially inefficiently slack in slumps. In turn, the unemployment gap is a crucial statistic to design labor-market and macroeconomic policies.\nFigure 7B: Unemployment gap in the United States, 1951–2019 Citation: Michaillat, Pascal and Emmanuel Saez. 2021. \u0026ldquo;Beveridgean Unemployment Gap.\u0026rdquo; Journal of Public Economics Plus 2: 100009. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubecp.2021.100009.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/9/","summary":"This paper develops a sufficient-statistic formula for the unemployment gap based on the Beveridge curve.

Because they do not observe firms\u0026rsquo; costs, customers must extract costs from prices. The theory assumes that customers infer less than rationally: When a price rises due to a cost increase, customers partially misattribute the higher price to a higher markup\u0026mdash;which they find unfair. Firms anticipate this response and trim their price increases, which drives the passthrough of costs into prices below one: Prices are somewhat rigid. Embedded in a New Keynesian model as a replacement for the usual pricing frictions, our theory produces monetary nonneutrality: When monetary policy loosens and inflation rises, customers misperceive markups as higher and feel unfairly treated; firms mitigate this perceived unfairness by reducing their markups; in general equilibrium, employment rises. The theory also features a hybrid short-run Phillips curve, realistic impulse responses of output and employment to monetary and technology shocks, and an upward-sloping long-run Phillips curve.\nFigure 1: Expansionary monetary shock in the New Keynesian model with fairness concerns Citation: Eyster, Erik, Kristof Madarasz, and Pascal Michaillat. 2021. \u0026ldquo;Pricing under Fairness Concerns.\u0026rdquo; Journal of the European Economic Association 19 (3): 1853–1898. https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaa041.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/8/","summary":"This paper develops a model of pricing in which buyers care about the fairness of markups but misinfer them from prices.

To resolve these anomalies, we introduce wealth into the utility function; the justification is that wealth is a marker of social status, and people value status. Since people partly save to accrue social status, the Euler equation is modified. As a result, when the marginal utility of wealth is sufficiently large, the dynamical system representing the zero-lower-bound equilibrium transforms from a saddle to a source, which resolves all the anomalies.\nFigure 1: Phase diagrams of the New Keynesian (NK) model and wealth-in-the-utility New Keynesian (WUNK) model, in normal times and at the zero lower bound (ZLB) Citation: Michaillat, Pascal and Emmanuel Saez. 2021. \u0026ldquo;Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies with Wealth in the Utility Function.\u0026rdquo; Review of Economics and Statistics 103 (2): 197\u0026ndash;215. https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00893.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/11/","summary":"This paper resolves the anomalies of the New Keynesian model at the zero lower bound\u0026mdash;explosive recession, forward guidance puzzle, multiplier puzzle\u0026mdash;by introducing wealth into the utility function.","title":"Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies with Wealth in the Utility Function"},{"content":" Paper Online appendix Code \u0026amp; data Abstract: This article proposes a theory of optimal public expenditure when unemployment is inefficient.

Such optimal \u0026ldquo;stimulus spending\u0026rdquo; is described by a formula expressed with three sufficient statistics: the unemployment gap, the unemployment multiplier (the decrease in unemployment achieved by increasing public expenditure), and the elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption. When unemployment is inefficiently high and the multiplier is positive, the formula yields the following results. (1) Optimal stimulus spending is positive and increasing in the unemployment gap. (2) Optimal stimulus spending is zero for a zero multiplier, increasing in the multiplier for small multipliers, largest for a moderate multiplier, and decreasing in the multiplier beyond that. (3) Optimal stimulus spending is zero if extra public goods have no value, it becomes larger as the elasticity of substitution increases, and it completely fills the unemployment gap if extra public goods are as valuable as extra private goods.\nFigures 7 \u0026amp; 8: Great Recession in the United States: optimal stimulus spending and resulting unemployment rate, for various multipliers and elasticities of substitution between public and private consumption (ε).

We evaluate this belief using a model of scientific research and promotion in which tenured scientists are slightly biased toward tenure candidates with similar beliefs. We find that when a science lacks evidence to discriminate between theories, or when tenure decisions do not rely on available evidence, true theories may not be adopted. The nonadoption of heliocentric theory in the 16th century, the persistence of bloodletting in the 19th century, the nonadoption of underconsumption theory in the early 20th century, and the persistence of radical mastectomy in the 20th century illustrate such risk.\nAbstract: We develop a model describing how false paradigms may persist, hindering scientific progress. The model features two paradigms, one describing reality better than the other. Tenured scientists display homophily: they favor tenure candidates who adhere to their paradigm. As in statistics, power is the probability (absent any bias) of denying tenure to scientists adhering to the false paradigm. The model shows that because of homophily, when power is low, the false paradigm may prevail. Then only an increase in power can ignite convergence to the true paradigm. Historical case studies suggest that low power comes either from lack of empirical evidence, or from reluctance to base tenure decisions on available evidence.\nFigure 1: Dynamics of the share of Better scientists (𝜎) in the tenured population depending on the power of the scientific field.

The optimal UI replacement rate is the Baily-Chetty replacement rate plus a correction term measuring the effect of UI on welfare through labor market tightness. Empirical evidence suggests that tightness is inefficiently low in slumps and inefficiently high in booms, and that an increase in UI raises tightness. Hence, the correction term is positive in slumps but negative in booms, and optimal UI is indeed countercyclical. Since there remains some uncertainty about the empirical evidence, the paper provides a thorough sensitivity analysis.\nFigures 7: Optimal UI replacement rate in the United States, 1990\u0026ndash;2014.

The optimal UI replacement rate is the conventional Baily-Chetty replacement rate, which solves the tradeoff between insurance and job-search incentives, plus a correction term, which is positive when an increase in UI pushes the labor market tightness toward its efficient level. In matching models, most wage mechanisms do not ensure efficiency, so tightness is generally inefficient. The effect of UI on tightness depends on the model: increasing UI may raise tightness by alleviating the rat race for jobs or lower tightness by increasing wages through bargaining.\nFigures 4: The effect of UI on labor market tightness differs across matching models; it can be measured by the wedge between the macroelasticity (ϵ^M) and microelasticity (ϵ^m) of unemployment with respect to UI Citation: Landais, Camille, Pascal Michaillat, and Emmanuel Saez. 2018. \u0026ldquo;A Macroeconomic Approach to Optimal Unemployment Insurance: Theory.\u0026rdquo; American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 10 (2): 152\u0026ndash;181. https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.20150088.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/4/","summary":"This paper develops a theory of optimal unemployment insurance in matching models, with implications for the cyclicality of optimal unemployment insurance.","title":"A Macroeconomic Approach to Optimal Unemployment Insurance: Theory"},{"content":" Paper Online appendix Code \u0026amp; data Abstract: This article develops a model of unemployment fluctuations. The model keeps the architecture of the general-disequilibrium model of Barro and Grossman (1971) but takes a matching approach to the labor and product markets instead of a disequilibrium approach. On the product and labor markets, both price and tightness adjust to equalize supply and demand. Since there are two equilibrium variables but only one equilibrium condition on each market, a price mechanism is needed to select an equilibrium. We focus on two polar mechanisms: fixed prices and competitive prices. When prices are fixed, aggregate demand affects unemployment as follows. An increase in aggregate demand leads firms to find more customers. This reduces the idle time of their employees and thus increases their labor demand. This in turn reduces unemployment. We combine the predictions of the model and empirical measures of product market tightness, labor market tightness, output, and employment to assess the sources of labor market fluctuations in the United States. First, we find that product market tightness and labor market tightness fluctuate a lot, which implies that the fixed-price equilibrium describes the data better than the competitive-price equilibrium. Next, we find that labor market tightness and employment are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor market fluctuations are mostly due to labor demand shocks and not to labor supply or mismatch shocks. Last, we find that product market tightness and output are positively correlated, which suggests that the labor demand shocks mostly reflect aggregate demand shocks and not technology shocks.\nFigures 1 \u0026amp; 3: Matching process and solution of the model of aggregate demand and idle time Citation: Michaillat, Pascal, and Emmanuel Saez. 2015. \u0026ldquo;Aggregate Demand, Idle Time, and Unemployment.\u0026rdquo; Quarterly Journal of Economics 130 (2): 507\u0026ndash;569. https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjv006.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/3/","summary":"This paper develops a model of unemployment fluctuations.

This multiplier indicates the additional number of workers employed when one worker is hired in the public sector. Graphically, in equilibrium, an upward-sloping quasi-labor supply intersects a downward-sloping labor demand in a (employment, labor market tightness) plane. Increasing public employment stimulates labor demand, which increases tightness and therefore crowds out private employment. Critically, the quasi-labor supply is convex. Hence, when labor demand is depressed and unemployment is high, the increase in tightness and resulting crowding-out are small.\nFigure 1: Effects of an increase in public employment (g) on private employment (l) and total employment (n) in good and bad times Citation: Michaillat, Pascal. 2014. \u0026ldquo;A Theory of Countercyclical Government Multiplier.\u0026rdquo; American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 6 (1): 190\u0026ndash;217. https://doi.org/10.1257/mac.6.1.190.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/2/","summary":"This paper develops a New Keynesian model in which the government-spending multiplier doubles when the unemployment rate rises from 5% to 8%.","title":"A Theory of  Countercyclical Government Multiplier"},{"content":" This course covers basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Dynamical systems are systems that involve more than one time-period; they are prevalent in macroeconomics. The course first discusses dynamic programming, a method to solve discrete-time optimization problems. It then turns to optimal control, a method to solve continuous-time optimization problems. Finally, it shows how to solve differential equations, which are key to describe continuous-time systems.\n","permalink":"https://pascalmichaillat.org/c3/","summary":"This course covers basic mathematical methods for macroeconomics: dynamic programming, differential equations, and optimal control.","title":"Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics"},{"content":" Paper Online appendix Code \u0026amp; data Abstract: This paper proposes a search-and-matching model of unemployment in which jobs are rationed: the labor market does not clear in the absence of matching frictions. This job shortage arises in an economic equilibrium from the combination of some wage rigidity and diminishing marginal returns to labor. In recessions, job rationing is acute, driving the rise in unemployment, whereas matching frictions contribute little to unemployment. Intuitively in recessions, jobs are lacking, the labor market is slack, and recruiting is easy and inexpensive, so matching frictions do not matter much. In a calibrated model, cyclical fluctuations in the composition of unemployment are large.\nFigure 5: Rationing and frictional unemployment in the United States, 1964\u0026ndash;2009 Citation: Michaillat, Pascal. 2012. \u0026ldquo;Do Matching Frictions Explain Unemployment?
