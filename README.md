# Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites

This repository contains the source code to https://pascalmichaillat.org: an academic website created with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

The code is publicly available as a template repository so anyone can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files, and quickly create their own academic website. The code might also be helpful to anyone who wishes to learn about Hugo or wants to recreate specific features of this website.

## Documentation

The source code is documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/.

## Features

The PaperMod theme is modified in several ways to be more adapted to academic websites:

+ Organization of the pages in three categories: papers, courses, and design projects. It is easy to add new categories from here (code, data, and so on). The three categories are available from any page through the menu and from the home page through buttons.
+ Automatically generated list of the keywords (tags) in papers and courses
+ New social icons specific to academia: office hours, Zoom, Substack, and Google Scholar
+ Page metadata tailored to the academic context: simpler date format, permalink on pages
+ Personalized color scheme, font, spacing, buttons, and general appearance
+ New archetypes for paper pages, course pages, an archive page, and a search page
+ A footer can easily be added

## Speed

Despite the modifications to the PaperMod theme, the website continues to perform well on both mobile and desktop devices. Here is an overview of the mobile performance from [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/):
