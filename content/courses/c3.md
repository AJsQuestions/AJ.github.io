This course covers basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Dynamical systems are systems that involve more than one time-period; they are prevalent in macroeconomics. The course first discusses dynamic programming, a method to solve discrete-time optimization problems. It then turns to optimal control, a method to solve continuous-time optimization problems. Finally, it shows how to solve differential equations, which are key to describe continuous-time  systems.
