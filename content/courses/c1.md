## Introduction

This course covers research topics related to unemployment. It discusses the models used to describe unemployment, and the policies used to tackle unemployment. It tries to answer several questions: Why does unemployment exist? Why does unemployment vary over the business cycle? What is the socially optimal level of unemployment? And how should labor-market policies such as unemployment insurance respond to spikes in unemployment?

## Matching function

This section reviews basic facts about the labor market and unemployment in the United States. It then introduces the matching function---the main tool that we will use to model the labor market and unemployment. The matching function summarizes the complex process through which workers searching for jobs and firms searching for employees meet each other.

## Matching model of the labor market

This section introduces the matching model of the labor market. This is the model that we will use to study unemployment and unemployment policies in this course. The model was developed by Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen, and Christopher Pissarides in the 1980s (for this they received a Nobel Prize in 2010).  Unlike in the  neoclassical model, in the matching model all trades  are mediated by the matching function. The section shows how to construct the labor supply and labor demand in the matching model, and how to solve the model using supply and demand.

## Wages

This section presents empirical evidence on wages. It then discusses various wage functions that can be used in the matching model---such as fixed wages, rigid wages, and bargained wages.

## Unemployment fluctuations

This section discusses unemployment fluctuations in the matching model. It first shows that the model with rigid wages generates realistic unemployment fluctuations. It then shows that the model with bargained wages is unable to generate such fluctuations. The reason is that bargained wages are too flexible.

## Frictional and rationing unemployment

This section turns to the sources of unemployment over the business cycle. It first establishes that usual matching models do not have job rationing. That is, all unemployment would disappear in these models if workers searched sufficiently hard. It then proposes a matching model with job rationing. In this model, in recession, jobs are lacking, so some unemployment remains even if workers are desperate to find a job. As a result, unemployment can be divided into a rationing and a frictional component. The frictional component is larger in good times and smaller in bad times.

## Efficient unemployment and unemployment gap

This section defines and computes the socially efficient level of unemployment in the matching model. It then extends the analysis to all models with a Beveridge curve---not only the matching model. It finally argues that in the United States unemployment is generally inefficient, and the unemployment gap is countercyclical.

## Government policies

Because unemployment fluctuations are inefficient, labor-market policies can be tailored  to maintain the unemployment rate closer to its efficient level or at least reduce the cost of unemployment fluctuations. This section discusses how minimum wage, payroll tax, public employment, and unemployment insurance should respond to unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.
