In the Spring 2023, I am on leave at the University of California--San Diego. I will therefore not hold regular office hours. But if you are a graduate student on the job market or at the research stage, and you would like to talk, please [email me](mailto:pascalmichaillat@brown.edu) to set up a zoom call.
