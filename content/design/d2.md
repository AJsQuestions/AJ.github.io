This template produces minimalist academic papers with LaTeX.
 <!-- [This newsletter post](https://pmichaillat.substack.com/p/a-minimalist-template-for-academic) explains the design choices made in the template. -->

## Download

- [paper.tex](/paper.tex) --  Skeleton for the paper. Fill it out with the content of your paper.
- [paper.sty](/paper.sty) --  LaTeX style file collecting all the formatting commands. Must be included in the same folder as `paper.tex`.
- [math.sty](/math.sty) -- LaTeX style file collecting many mathematical commands. Must be included in the same folder as `paper.tex`. This file is described [on this page](/d3/). 
- [bibliography.bst](/bibliography.bst) -- LaTeX style file to format academic bibliographies. Must be included in the same folder as `paper.tex`.
- [paper.pdf](/paper.pdf) -- PDF file produced by compiling `paper.tex` (with PDFTeX; requires figures and bibliography). This file is not required to use the template; it only illustrate the output of the template. 

<!-- ## and how to use them

- `presentation.tex` –  Skeleton of the presentation. Fill it out with the content of your presentation.
- `presentation.sty` –  LaTeX style file collecting all the formatting commands. Must be included in the same folder as `presentation.tex`.
- `math.sty` – LaTeX style file collecting many mathematical commands. Must be included in the same folder as `presentation.tex`. This file is hosted and described [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math). 
- `figures.pdf` – PDF file with all the figures included in the presentation. Replace the figures with your own figures---one per page. An easy way to do that is to create a Keynote or Powerpoint presentation; insert each figure as a slide background; and save the resulting presentation as PDF. With this method, all the figures have the exact same size. It is also possible to use Keynote or Powerpoint to annotate easily the figures created with an external software (Matlab, R, and so on).
- `presentation.pdf` – PDF file produced by compiling `presentation.tex` (with PDFTeX). This file is not required to use the template; it only illustrate the output of the template. -->

- No colors are used in the text (only black and gray) to reduce distraction.
- Colors are reserved for graphs.
