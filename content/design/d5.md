## View template

The source code for this website is publicly available as a [template repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pmichaillat/pmichaillat.github.io). Anybody can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files, and therefore quickly create their own academic website.

## Tools used

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) -- A very fast, open-source static website generator 
- [Papermod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) -- A minimalist, fast, and flexible Hugo theme
- [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) --  The website is hosted in a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) and produced from there using [GitHub Actions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google) -- A simple way to register your domain name and [link it to your website](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) 

## Key features

I modified the original theme to be more adapted to an academic website:

- Added social icons office hours, Zoom, and Substack, and improved the social icon for Google Scholar
- Modified footer to have easy access to email address and newsletter
- Adjusted metadata for academic context (date format, permalink)
- Organized pages in three categories: papers, courses, and design projects. It is easy to add new categories from here (code, data, etc.)
- Developed templates for paper pages and course pages
- Personalized color scheme and general appearance
