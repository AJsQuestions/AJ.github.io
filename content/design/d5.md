## Overview

The source code to [this website](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) is publicly available as a template repository, so anyone can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files, and quickly create their own academic website. The code might also be helpful to anyone who wishes to recreate specific features of this website. 

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which is a very fast, open-source static website generator. The website design is based on [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), which is a minimalist, fast, and flexible Hugo theme. Finally, the website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages); but it could easily be hosted by other services.

The design has been customized for academic websites. The first goal was to obtain a minimalist website that is easy to navigate and easy to maintain. The second goal was to obtain a website that highlights the research and teaching material. The final goal was to have a website that performs well (fast to load, good SEO, good accessibility, and so on). The website [performs very well](https://github.com/pmichaillat/pmichaillat.github.io#performance) on mobile and desktop devices—just like the original PaperMod theme.

## Download

+ [Source code to this website](https://github.com/pmichaillat/pmichaillat.github.io)

---

## Installation

+ Clone the repository to your local machine
+ Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/). On a Mac, this is easily done with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): simply run `brew install hugo` in the terminal.
+ Since the website is hosted on GitHub Pages, the website can conveniently be updated by [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

---

## Usage

### Website development

To check that everything works, experiment with the code, and slowly develop your website, start by rebuilding the website locally. In the terminal, navigate to your website directory and run `hugo server` from there. The command builds the website with Hugo and starts a local web server. The website is then available at http://localhost:1313 in any web browser. Hugo automatically rebuilds the site and refreshes the web page in the browser as changes are made to the files (content, templates) in the repository. This allows you to see changes instantly as you are developing your website. 

### Website compilation

Once your website is ready to be made public, run `hugo` in the terminal from your website directory. This command will convert content files into HTML pages, handles static assets, generates URLs and organizes pages, and finally compile the website into the `public` folder for deployment.

### Website deployment

With GitHub Desktop, you can just commit the changes and push them to the GitHub repository online. Then, [GitHub Actions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) will build the website and deploy it to GitHub Pages. The workflow is in the `hugo.yml` file stored in the `.github/workflows` folder. It usually takes a few minutes for the website to be deployed and go live.

## Configuration file

Upon cloning the source code to your local machine, make sure to update the parameters that are specific to your website in the configuration file `config.yml`. Such parameters include:

+ `baseURL` – The website URL
+ `title` – Your name, to be used as title of the website
+ `params:author` - Your name, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the author of the webpage's content (this only adds a meta tag to the header of the homepage, it doesn't have any direct impact on the appearance or functionality of the webpage itself)
+ `params:description` – A short description (less than 155 characters) of who you are, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the content of the webpage (this description often appears in search engine results below the title of the webpage)
+ `params:googleAnalyticsID` – The website's Google Analytics ID (the website supports Google Analytics)
+ `params:profileMode:title` – Your name, to be used as title on the homepage
+ `params:profileMode:subtitle` – A description of who you are, to be used as a subtitle on the homepage
+ `params:profileMode:imageTitle` – Your name, to be used as tag for your profile picture
+ `params:socialIcons` – The URLs to your social accounts

---

## Content organization

The content of the website is organized in three categories, which are available from any page through the navigation menu and from the home page through buttons:

+ [Papers](https://pascalmichaillat.org/papers/) – List of published and unpublished research papers, with links to individual paper pages
+ [Courses](https://pascalmichaillat.org/courses/) – List of undergraduate and graduate courses taught, with links to individual course pages
+ [Design projects](https://pascalmichaillat.org/design/) – List of various design projects, with links to individual project pages
+ It is easy to add new categories from here (code, data, and so on). 

---

## Static files

The files in the `static` folder are PDF files and images to which the website links. All the files currently in the `static` folder pertain to this website and can be safely deleted, with the exception of the following files:

+ `picture.jpeg` is the picture appearing on the homepage. Replace it with your own picture.
+ `cv.pdf` is the CV linked to the CV icon on the homepage. Replace it with your own CV.
+ `favicon.io`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `favicon-16x16.png`, and `apple-touch-icon.png` is the favicon appearing in the menu bar next to the website title, and in the browser next to the URL. Replace it with the [favicon of your choice](https://favicon.io).

---

## Archetypes

The template comes with archetypes for paper pages (`archetypes/paper.md`) and course pages (`archetypes/course.md`). In Hugo, an archetype is a predefined content template that serves as a blueprint for creating new pages. Archetypes help streamline content creation by providing a consistent starting point with predefined metadata and content structure.

To create a new webpage from an archetype, simply use the `hugo new` command in the terminal from the website directory. For example, to create a page for a new course, you can run:

```console
hugo new content/courses/my-new-teaching-material.md --kind course
```

Hugo will generate a new content file called `my-new-teaching-material.md` and place it the directory `content/courses/`, where all the courses are stored. Furthermore, Hugo will use the archetype `course.md`. Then, you can edit the content of the page by modifying the newly created file `my-new-teaching-material.md`. 

Similarly, to create a page for a new paper, you can run:

```console
hugo new content/papers/my-new-research-material.md --kind paper
```

Hugo will generate a new content file called `my-new-research-material.md` and place it the directory `content/papers/`, where all the papers are stored. Furthermore, Hugo will use the archetype `paper.md`.

---

## Social icons

The website includes new social icons specific to academia: 

+ Office hours – Use `name: Office Hours` below `params:socialIcons:` in `config.yml`
+ Zoom – Use `name: Zoom` below `params:socialIcons:` in `config.yml`
+ Substack – Use `name: Substack` below `params:socialIcons:` in `config.yml`
+ Google Scholar – Use `name: Google Scholar` below `params:socialIcons:` in `config.yml`
+ All the icons are defined in the file `layouts/partials/svg.html`; additional icons can be added there

---

## Tags

A list of all the [tags](https://pascalmichaillat.org/tags/) (or keywords) used in papers and courses is automatically generated and added to the website. 

---

## Archive

An archive can also be added to the website. The archive displays a chronological list of all papers, courses, and design projects.

+ Place `archetypes/archive.md` into `content/`
+ Add the following snippet below `menu:main:` in `config.yml` to make the archive available from the menu: 

```yml
- name: Archive  
  url: /archive/  
  weight: 7
```

+ The archive will also be available at `baseURL/archive/`

  ---
  
## Search page

A search page can also be added to the website:

+ Place `archetypes/search.md` into `content/`
+ Add the following snippet at the end of `config.yml` for search to work:

```yml
outputs:
     home:
         - HTML
         - RSS
         - JSON
```

+ Add the following snippet below `menu:main:` in `config.yml` to make the search available from the menu:

```yml
- name: Search  
  url: /search/  
  weight: 6
```

+ The search page will also be available at `baseURL/search/`

---

## Footer

The website does not have a footer, but it is possible to add one:

+ Set `hideFooter`to `false` in `config.yml`
+ The footer contains a copyright notice and a "powered by" notice
+ The footer can be customized by modifying the file `layouts/partials/footer.html`

---

## Other modifications of PaperMod

+ The page metadata is tailored to the academic context, with a simple date format and permalinks for published articles and other projects.
+ Color scheme, font, spacing, buttons, and general appearance have been streamlined and made as minimalist as possible.

---

## Public folder

The `public` folder contains the fully generated static website files that are ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages. When you run the `hugo` command, Hugo processes your content, templates, and other project files and generates a static website. The resulting output is placed in the `public` folder by default.

The `public` folder in the template can therefore be safely deleted. A new version of the `public` folder will be created when you run the `hugo` command from your own repository.
