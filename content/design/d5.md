## Overview

The source code to this website is publicly available as a template repository, so anyone can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files, and quickly create their own academic website. The code might also be helpful to anyone who wishes to recreate specific features of this website. 

The website was built with Hugo, PaperMod, and GitHub pages. It was designed to be as minimalist as possible so that it is easy to navigate, fast to load, easy to maintain, and especially so the focus is on the research and teaching material.

## Features

The PaperMod theme is tailored to be more adapted to academic websites:

+ Organization of the pages in three categories: 
    - [Papers](https://pascalmichaillat.org/papers/) – List of published and unpublished research papers, with links to individual paper pages
    - [Courses](https://pascalmichaillat.org/courses/) – List of undergraduate and graduate courses taught, with links to individual course pages
    - [Design projects](https://pascalmichaillat.org/design/) – List of various design projects, with links to individual project pages
    - It is easy to add new categories from here (code, data, and so on). 
    - The three categories are available from any page through the navigation menu and from the home page through buttons.
+ Two automatically generated lists added to the menu:
    - [Tags](https://pascalmichaillat.org/tags/) – List of all the keywords for papers and courses
    - [Archive](https://pascalmichaillat.org/archive/) – Chronological list of all papers, courses, and design projects
+ A search page could also be added by
    + Placing `archetypes/search.md` into `content/`
    + Adding the following snippet below `menu:main:` in `config.yml`: 
```yml
- name: Search  
  url: /search/  
  weight: 6
```
