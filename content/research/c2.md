## Description
### Part Time (1 Year)
**Supervised by:** Prof. Dacheng Xiu (Professor of Econometrics and Statistics)
#### Zillow Offers: Financial Intermediation in the Real Estate Market via Machine Learning
+ Used the Zillow Kaggle Competition Dataset to preprocess Real Estate Pricing Error data in Python.
+ Made exploratory and statistical data analysis for reports.
+ Developed supervised machine learning regression models: linear, regularized, and non-parametric to predict pricing error; evaluated and contrasted the models using standard machine learning practices.
+ Detailed systematic factors of data contributing to the space of pricing error for real estate markets like location, tax variables, and house fundamentals.
+ Created Assignments and Lecture Content from material studied in the project, with expositions and explanations of various machine learning theory topics for MBA students (eg. k-fold cross validation).

#### LendingClub: P2P Credit Default using Machine Learning
+ Used the public LendingClub dataset to preprocess Real Estate Pricing Error data in Python.
+ Made exploratory and statistical data analysis for reports.
+ Developed supervised machine learning classification models: linear, regularized, and non-parametric to predict default rate; evaluated and contrasted the models using standard machine learning practices.
+ Detailed systematic factors of data contributing to the space of default rate and probability.
+ Created Assignments and Lecture Content from material studied in the project, with expositions and explanations of various machine learning theory topics for MBA students (eg. classification metrics).
